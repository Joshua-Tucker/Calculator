QUESTIONS

NOTES 

Okay im going to think out loud with my current understanding of using forEach and how we can use that to interact with the operators. Once i think i have an idea of how to do something (or even if I fall flat) then im going to research online on code to use because im not confident with tthe layout process just yet and i feel like that is where im going to get bugs because i dont know how to use them appropriatley yet.

i know havew the numbers showing up in the display, i guess the first thing to do would be to declare the rest of the symbols so i can then play around with them.
then i guess the logic would be ...
if (number) + (operator) + (number) + (equals) has been selected
then show on display 
(answer with math applied)
in order to get answer ...
answer = (number value) + (operator value) + (number value)
