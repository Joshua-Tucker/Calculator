# Calculator

# Calculator

Okay project 2

BREIF
A deployed website (using GitHub Pages)
2.  A public GitHub repository for your codebase
1.  A README.md with a short intro to the project
2.  At least 15 Git commits for the different stages in your development
3.  Be responsive and built mobile-first, it should work on different screen widths
4.  Accept a minimum of 2 inputs, perform an operation and show the output
5.  DOES NOT USE THE eval() method (as this is extremely dangerous) TICK
6.  Code is highly readable (good naming and indented correctly

PLAN

-Go for basic iphone style calculator
-Write HTML and SCSS for this
-Add JS as we go
-When we are happy with functionality of calculator we can then change the layout

I'm getting marked on my integration of all 3 languages now, no point in making it look super fancy and spend loads of time on that if it doesn't work.

TIME AVAILABLE

WED PM
    Write up html and scss TICK
THURS PM
    Finish layout and research on how to apply functionality
FRI ALL DAY (?)
    Integrate JS
SAT BONUS DAY
    Integrate JS
MON PM
    Integrate JS
TUES PM
    If happy with functionality spice up the css

**HAND IN TUESDAY 4PM**



QUESTIONS
How to create function to do mathematical process of the button its presssing
How to write it so its not limited to num1 + num2 = x and can include multiple numbers and multiple operators




NOTES 

Okay im going to think out loud with my current understanding of using forEach and how we can use that to interact with the operators. Once i think i have an idea of how to do something (or even if I fall flat) then im going to research online on code to use because im not confident with tthe layout process just yet and i feel like that is where im going to get bugs because i dont know how to use them appropriatley yet.

i know havew the numbers showing up in the display, i guess the first thing to do would be to declare the rest of the symbols so i can then play around with them. TICK 
then i guess the logic would be ...
if (number) + (operator) + (number) + (equals) has been selected
then show on display 
(answer with math applied)
in order to get answer ...
answer = (number value) + (operator value) + (number value) 


I would need to then apply each operator with the mathematical sum that java recognises that relates to the button im pressing


what im going to do after lunch is go over the breif again and see what ive done and what else needs doing.
then im going to write code for the percentage and =/- operator
from there and ive got a working calculator i want to stop relying so heavily on robs handholding and get used to writing the code myself. the rest of friday would be to take the code ive written, look over it and talk it out so i understand what its doing and how to write each statment then remove code (stored in a safe place obviously) and do the whole thing over again. 

I wont learn until i start doing it myself and making those internal connections by trial and error. I know it, its there to refer back to ONLY IF I CANNOT SOLVE IT, so its time to practise and get those drills in.

OBSERVATIONS

THINGS TO DO
-go over breif
-go over code
-get the last 2 symbols working
-ensure its responsive
-ensure text stays in display box and doesnt change overall design
-Highlight operator to clarify youve pressed on them
-change scss so it looks slick
-refector work if i can
